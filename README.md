amarakon.com – Amarakon’s Website
================

This is my personal website. It has an about page, my links, tags, and
blog posts. The theme for the website is Nord, based on
[Fuji](https://github.com/dsrkafuu/hugo-theme-fuji/). I upload to my
blog almost every day. Sometimes I will go several days without
uploading because I am too busy. My blog posts are about politics,
technology, markup, Linux. I will get a proper domain name soon:
amarakon.com instead of amarakon.github.io/amarakon.com.
