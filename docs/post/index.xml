      <description>Introduction I am a high school student who happens to be genuinely interested in technology. Specifically, I am interested in operating systems and programming (coding). The pandemic gave teachers an excuse to be lazy and government the excuse to be tyrannical. The government did an uncountable amount of lockdowns and schools went online during them. Exams were canceled, so it is unsurprising that the majority of students supported the cruel lockdowns as well. Since we were dependent on technology for school, what I have noticed is that education wants to dumb down technology.
Classroom is Terrible We used a website developed by Google called Classroom.</description>

      <description>Introduction What I have noticed about many subjects in life is that many people just want to be sheep. Notice how I said &amp;ldquo;want to be sheep&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;are sheep.&amp;rdquo; That is because my emphasis is on the fact that people are choosing to be ignorant. This is true in many cases, especially in politics and computing. In this post, I will be focusing on computing. I want to clarify by saying that I think there is nothing wrong with being ignorant, but it is wrong to be willfully ignorant.
I remember a couple of years ago I was a very different person than I am today.</description>
