      <description>Introduction What I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed about many subjects in life is that many people just want to be sheep. Notice how I said &amp;ldquo;want to be sheep&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;are sheep.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s because my emphasis is on the fact that people are choosing to be ignorant. This is true in many cases, especially in politics and computing. In this post, I will be focusing on computing. I want to clarify by saying that I think there is nothing wrong with being ignorant, but it is wrong to be willfully ignorant.
I remember a couple of years ago I was a very different person than I am today.</description>
