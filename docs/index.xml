      <description>Introduction What I’ve noticed about many subjects in life is that many people just want to be sheep. Notice how I said “want to be sheep” and not “are sheep.” That’s because my emphasis is on the fact that people are choosing to be ignorant. This is true in many cases, especially in politics and computing. In this video, I will be focusing on computing. I want to clarify by saying that I think there is nothing wrong with being ignorant, but it is wrong to be willfully ignorant.
I remember a couple of years ago I was a very different person than I am today.</description>
