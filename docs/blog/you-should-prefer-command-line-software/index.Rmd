There are many benefits of preferring command-line software over graphical software.
Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) generally promote lazy thinking. 
Command-line interfaces (CLI) generally promote critical thinking.
I think it is unfortunate that most people have not even heard of command-line software.
Whenever I would be doing my work in school by running commands, most people who pass by would assume that I am coding.
This is obviously because they have not used command-line programs, so their view of a dark terminal window and fast typing of commands they do not understand leads them to this conclusion.
That then leads them to the conclusion that anything other than a graphical, modern "app" is too difficult for them.
This is why most people do not use command-line software.

In order to efficiently use computers, you need to get rid of this mindset.

# Unix Philosophy

**Ken Thompson**:

> This is the Unix philosophy:
Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Write programs to work together.
Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

## Do one thing and do it well

## Work together

## Handle text streams because that is a universal interface
