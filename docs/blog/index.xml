      <description>Most people view programming as something that only a specific type of people are able to do and should do. This specific type of person is portrayed as a genius; smarter than everyone else. This means that they think most normal people are unable to learn programming because they are not smart enough. But since they do not want to learn it themselves, they make the excuse that it is not important for them. It does not require smartness to learn programming, it only requires time, desire, and effort.
Time A common excuse for dozens of things outside of programming is “I don’t have enough time.</description>

      <description>Gentoo Linux is a 100% free operating system. All of its source code is publicly available on GitHub, meaning that it’s open-source. It is licensed under a free license: GNU General Public License (Version 2). It does not include any preinstalled proprietary software. Its package manager, Portage, blocks proprietary software against the user’s will by default. All of these reasons prove that is a completely free operating system that is against the use of proprietary software, so it should be in the Free Software Foundation’s (FSF) list of free Linux distributions .
Free System Distribution Guidelines (GNU, 2022b ) The GNU free system distribution guidelines (GNU FSDG) is an article supported by the FSF.</description>

      <title>Gentoo Linux: The Best Operating System Ever Made</title>

      <description>In my previous blog post titled How to Install Gentoo – The Efficient Way, I said that Gentoo Linux is “truly the best operating system of all time” (Al-Zubaidi, 2022 ). I stand by that statement and there are many reasons as to why I think it is. The top three currently most popular operating systems are Windows 10, macOS, and Chrome OS. You may or may not have heard of Linux.

Technically, Linux is not an operating in and of itself, rather it is the core of the operating system and each distribution should provide all the additional programs required for that distribution.</description>

      <description>So you finally moved from the beginner distributions and you know want to install truly the best operating system of all time; Gentoo Linux. Contrary to popular belief, installing this operating system is not difficult in the slightest but it is certainly time consuming. Usually it will take around five hours to install. This might deter you, but remember that this operating system will actually save you time in the long run. Not only is it faster than other operating systems, it also makes the user more intelligent, leading to efficient computer usage. No current Gentoo user regrets spending five hours installing the operating system to save many more hours in total.</description>

      <title>Education Wants to Dumb Down Technology</title>

      <description>I am a high school student who happens to be genuinely interested in technology. Specifically, I am interested in operating systems, programming, and free software philosophy . I have a good understanding of what makes a good piece of technology and what makes a bad piece of technology. One of the most important factors in this distinction is the effort it requires to use it. If a piece of technology is extremely complicated but effortless to use (i.e., dumbed down), then it is generally bad. If a piece of technology is minimalist but requires genuine effort to use (e.g., C, LaTeX, flip-phones), then it is generally good.</description>

      <title>You Should Pay Attention to Your Choice of Software</title>

      <description>What I have noticed about many subjects in life is that many people just want to be sheep. Notice how I said &amp;ldquo;want to be sheep&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;are sheep.&amp;rdquo; That is because my emphasis is on the fact that people are choosing to be ignorant. This is true in many cases, especially in politics and computing. In this post, I will be focusing on computing. I want to clarify by saying that I think there is nothing wrong with being ignorant, but it is wrong to be willfully ignorant.
I remember a couple of years ago I was a very different person than I am today.</description>
