      <description>So you finally moved from the beginner distributions and you know want to install truly the best operating system of all time; Gentoo Linux. Contrary to popular belief, installing this operating system is not difficult in the slightest but it is certainly time consuming. Usually it will take around five hours to install. This might deter you, but remember that this operating system will actually save you time in the long run. Not only is it faster than other operating systems, it also makes the user more intelligent, leading to efficient computer usage. No current Gentoo user regrets spending five hours installing the operating system to save many more hours in total.</description>
