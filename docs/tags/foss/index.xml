      <description>In my previous blog post titled How to Install Gentoo – The Efficient Way, I said that Gentoo Linux is “truly the best operating system of all time” (Al-Zubaidi, 2022). I stand by that statement and there are many reasons as to why I think it is. The top three currently most popular operating systems are Windows 10, macOS, and Chrome OS. You may or may not have heard of Linux.

Technically, Linux is not an operating in and of itself, rather it is the core of the operating system and each distribution should provide all the additional programs required for that distribution.</description>

      <description>So you finally moved from the beginner distributions and you know want to install truly the best operating system of all time; Gentoo Linux. Contrary to popular belief, installing this operating system is not difficult in the slightest but it is certainly time consuming. Usually it will take around five hours to install. This might deter you, but remember that this operating system will actually save you time in the long run. Not only is it faster than other operating systems, it also makes the user more intelligent, leading to efficient computer usage. No current Gentoo user regrets spending five hours installing the operating system to save many more hours in total.</description>

      <description>What I have noticed about many subjects in life is that many people just want to be sheep. Notice how I said &amp;ldquo;want to be sheep&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;are sheep.&amp;rdquo; That is because my emphasis is on the fact that people are choosing to be ignorant. This is true in many cases, especially in politics and computing. In this post, I will be focusing on computing. I want to clarify by saying that I think there is nothing wrong with being ignorant, but it is wrong to be willfully ignorant.
I remember a couple of years ago I was a very different person than I am today.</description>
