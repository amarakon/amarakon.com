        I always support minimizing the amount of money you spend on technology. I have made that crystal clear. There are many things that people are spending way too much money on. But there are also many things that people are buying that they do not even need. An example of this is the mouse.
Figure 1: Cool gaming mouse
 No, not that mouse. I am talking about computer mice. Computer mice are usually cheap; not costing more than $20. But the amount of money people spend on them adds up. They do not last nearly as long as keyboards do.

        It is important to favor timeless computers over timed ones. Timed computers are designed to last only a short period of time; maybe a year or so. This is because they are designed to be not only fragile but also difficult to repair. This cruel combination manifests a consumerist mindset into most people. Timeless computers are designed to last as long as possible. They are always durable and reliable, not just the hardware but also the software.
Aspects of a Timed Computer Timed computers usually take the form of Macbooks and Surfaces. Macbooks are thin, light, and sleek. But they are built for an extremely restrictive, oppressive ecosystem.

        Many people feel the need to spend a lot of money on technology. They think that because technology is complex and vast, they should buy from the most expensive brands. I think that the opposite is true. Because technology is complex and vast, we should buy cheap but great tech products. Most importantly, we should buy technology that we actually understand. Ultra-complex technology takes advantage of everyone who uses it because no one can understand it. This is why we should only use technology that is simple and easy to understand. You can get by spending one quarter of what most people spend.

        Qualifications In order for me to consider them good, web browsers must
  not send analytics. It should not make analytics either. I do not want to hear about how it maintains the software’s survival. I genuinely do not care. I do not want “bug reports.”
  have no home pages. Seriously, I do not want my browser to start on Google. The address bar is there for a reason. Good luck to people who are too stupid to know how to use it.
  respect users’ privacy. Web browsers must minimize telemetry as much as possible. Sometimes, telemetry is necessary.

        There is sadly too little debate about if you should disallow your kid to have a smartphone. This is an important discussion. There are good arguments for and against it. But most people just let their kids do whatever without thinking through it deeply. This is dangerous and careless behavior. You should heavily regulate what your kids are able to do to protect them, as a parent always should. There should be no exceptions for smartphones.

        You cannot change the reality of who you are. You cannot change your race, sex, age because those are immutable properties. Most people in society understand and accept this fact. But the left has created terms called “gender” and “transgender” to get around this. They know believe it is possible to change one’s sex, but they relabeled it as “gender.” They argue that sex is biological while gender is a social construct. Well, if sex is the biological truth and gender is a made-up, incorrect social construct, why should not we be truthful and get rid of the made-up, incorrect social construct?

        Jordan Peterson is a Canadian clinical psychologist that is now known for his counter-narrative political views. He became famous after standing up against Bill C-16 which forces compelled speech. He is also mainly known for criticizing the radical left. He is often described as conservative by the right. However, just because he criticizes left-wing extremists, does not mean he is a conservative He said in an interview that he’s “no right-winger.”
  Bill C-16 Bill C-16 is a bill passed by the Parliament of Canada titled An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code. It states that “gender identity and expression” are prohibited grounds of discrimination.

        PDF is rightfully the standard output format for documents. All word processors can output to PDF, but it is difficult to convert PDF to files word processors can edit. Most people use “what you see is what you get” word processors like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or LibreOffice Writer. This type of word processor is convenient but it is also limited and unprofessional. It is easier to get into, but it is harder to use in the long run. This is the problem with all “what you see is what you get” programs: they do not follow the “separation of content and presentation” design principle.

        Conservatives and liberals strongly disagree on when killing another human being should be considered acceptable. They both agree that killing is justified in self-defense, but the agreements end there. Conservatives usually think that abortion and euthanasia are wrong while capital punishment (the death penalty) is just. They argue that killing an innocent and defenseless person (abortion and euthanasia) is always wrong while killing soulless criminals (the death penalty) is just. On the other hand, liberals think that abortion and euthanasia are sometimes justifiable while the death penalty is unjust. They argue that it is a woman’s right to choose, we should end the suffering of ill people, and that the death penalty is too harsh and cruel.

        There are many benefits of preferring command-line software over graphical software. Graphical User Interfaces generally promote lazy thinking. Command-line interfaces generally promote critical thinking. I think it is unfortunate that most people have not even heard of command-line software. Whenever I would be doing my work in school by running commands, most people who pass by would assume that I am coding. This is obviously because they have not used command-line programs, so their view of a dark terminal window and fast typing of commands they do not understand leads them to this conclusion. That then leads them to the conclusion that anything other than a modern graphical “app” is too difficult for them.
