      <description>Similar to my programs page, this webpage will list programs that I endorse. But this is only for programs that I have specifically created. My software projects are available on GitHub. And I have plenty of good ones. I believe they should be more popular, but I am not sure how to bring more attention to them. Hopefully this web page will help explain why I created them and why you should use them.

      <description>Most people view programming as something that only a specific type of people are able to do and should do. This specific type of person is portrayed as a genius; smarter than everyone else. This means that they think most normal people are unable to learn programming because they are not smart enough. But since they do not want to learn it themselves, they make the excuse that it is not important for them. It does not require smartness to learn programming, it only requires time, desire, and effort.

      <description>I am a high school student who happens to be genuinely interested in technology. Specifically, I am interested in operating systems, programming, and free software philosophy. I have a good understanding of what makes a good piece of technology and what makes a bad piece of technology. One of the most important factors in this distinction is the effort it requires to use it. If a piece of technology is extremely complicated but effortless to use (i.e., dumbed down), then it is generally bad. If a piece of technology is minimalist but requires genuine effort to use (e.g., C, LaTeX, flip-phones), then it is generally good.</description>
