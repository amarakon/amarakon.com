      <description>I always support minimizing the amount of money you spend on technology. I have made that crystal clear. There are many things that people are spending way too much money on. But there are also many things that people are buying that they do not even need. An example of this is the mouse.

 No, not that mouse. I am talking about computer mice. Computer mice are usually cheap; not costing more than $20. But the amount of money people spend on them adds up. They do not last nearly as long as keyboards do.</description>

      <description>It is important to favor timeless computers over timed ones. Timed computers are designed to last only a short period of time; maybe a year or so. This is because they are designed to be not only fragile but also difficult to repair. This cruel combination manifests a consumerist mindset into most people. Timeless computers are designed to last as long as possible. They are always durable and reliable, not just the hardware but also the software.
Aspects of a Timed Computer Timed computers usually take the form of Macbooks and Surfaces. Macbooks are thin, light, and sleek. But they are built for an extremely restrictive, oppressive ecosystem.</description>
