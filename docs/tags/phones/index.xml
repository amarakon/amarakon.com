      <description>There is sadly too little debate about if you should disallow your kid to have a smartphone. This is an important discussion. There are good arguments for and against it. But most people just let their kids do whatever without thinking through it deeply. This is dangerous and careless behavior. You should heavily regulate what your kids are able to do to protect them, as a parent always should. There should be no exceptions for smartphones.
I saw a post on Quora titled My almost 16-year-old daughter wants a smartphone. How do I get her to stop bugging me about it?</description>
