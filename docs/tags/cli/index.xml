      <description>There are many benefits of preferring command-line software over graphical software. Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) generally promote lazy thinking. Command-line interfaces (CLI) generally promote critical thinking. I think it is unfortunate that most people have not even heard of command-line software. Whenever I would be doing my work in school by running commands, most people who pass by would assume that I am coding. This is obviously because they have not used command-line programs, so their view of a dark terminal window and fast typing of commands they do not understand leads them to this conclusion. That then leads them to the conclusion that anything other than a graphical, modern “app” is too difficult for them.</description>
