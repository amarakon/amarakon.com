title: My Software Projects and Why You Should Follow Them

Similar to my [programs](/programs/) page, this webpage will list programs that I endorse.
But this is only for programs that I have specifically created.
My software projects are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/amarakon).
And I have plenty of good ones.
I believe they should be more popular, but I am not sure how to bring more attention to them.
Hopefully this web page will help explain why I created them and why you should use them.

[AmaRYAML](https://github.com/amarakon/amaryaml)
: It has a terrible name but this is basically a collection of R Markdown templates.
There are currently five templates available in the *amaryaml* package:

    1. Book
    1. Eisvogel
    
       This is basically a simple document template.
       It is much better than the default pandoc template.
    
    1. GitHub
    
       The main advantage of using this template over the default R Markdown `github_document` output is that this template shifts heading levels by 1.
       This basically means that you can use `#` headings instead of `##` headings.
       It is a minor issue that I think is worth using my template to fix.
    
    1. NorBeam
    
       This is a slideshow template that uses the Nord color scheme.
       It looks much better than any other beamer theme.
    
    1. Leaflet

       There is no good documentation on how to make leaflets in R Markdown.
       With this template, it is already set up for you.
       It could not be easier than this.

[Amarlay](https://github.com/amarakon/amarlay)
: Unlike AmaRYAML, Amarlay has a great name.
It is a Gentoo overlay that includes 52 unique packages, most of them not found in any other repository.
Obviously, this will only be useful to Gentoo users.
The best packages it includes are Zsh plugins, *nerd-fonts-inconsolata*, *cfetch*, and many Neovim plugins.
It also includes ebuilds for all of my GitHub repositories.
So if you are a gentoo user, and you like my software, enable this overlay!

[DFM](https://github.com/amarakon/dfm)
: The dmenu file manager is the best and fastest way to manage files!
It is even faster than using the terminal, but has the perks of a graphical user interface.
Therefore, it has the best of both worlds.
You can use it to quickly open files in literally around one second.
And unlike graphical file managers, it supports shell abbreviations such as `..`, `*`, and `~`.
You can also quickly go back to any directory by typing part of its name!
This is my best project so far, and it is definitely criminally underrated.
I guess it is better explained visually:

[FFRec](https://github.com/amarakon/ffrec)
: It is annoying when the command-line option is too minimalist while the graphical option is too bloated.
FFRec uses FFmpeg to record but makes it less of a hassle.
It makes it just as easy to record with FFmpeg as it is with OBS.
Actually, it is even easier.
No setup is required because the defaults are already fantastic.
But if they do not suit you, you can change them with command-line options or the configuration file.

[MagickShot](https://github.com/amarakon/magickshot)
: MagickShot is like FFRec but for screenshots instead of recordings.
It simplifies ImageMagick so you do not feel the need to use scrot or Flameshot.
It can screenshot the selection, the window, the monitor, or the entire display.
And it does it just like magic ðŸ˜‰.
What is there more to say?

# Conclusion

Those are my top five best software projects.
But I have created many more great things.
I have 25 [repositories](https://github.com/amarakon?tab=repositories) in total.
If you want to see more, please check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/amarakon) page.
I plan on making [YouTube](https://vid.puffyan.us/channel/UCbZc671K2NxNbr1Kfqz6Fmg) videos about my projects as well, so stay tuned for that.
