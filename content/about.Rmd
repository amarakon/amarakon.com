My name is Amar Al-Zubaidi; I am an Iraqi-Canadian high school student.
I am interested in many things:

- freedom
- free software philosophy
- minimalism
- GNU/Linux
  - Gentoo
  - Arch
- programming
  - C
  - R
  - Shell
- markup
  - R Markdown
  - LaTeX

On [my GitHub](https://github.com/amarakon) is where I have all my projects.
I also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbZc671K2NxNbr1Kfqz6Fmg).
I will be creating many blog posts on this website and I might upload more videos on my YouTube channel.
