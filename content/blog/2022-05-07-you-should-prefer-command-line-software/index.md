There are many benefits of preferring command-line software over graphical software.
Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) generally promote lazy thinking.
Command-line interfaces (CLI) generally promote critical thinking.
I think it is unfortunate that most people have not even heard of command-line software.
Whenever I would be doing my work in school by running commands, most people who pass by would assume that I am coding.
This is obviously because they have not used command-line programs, so their view of a dark terminal window and fast typing of commands they do not understand leads them to this conclusion.
That then leads them to the conclusion that anything other than a modern graphical “app” is too difficult for them.
This is why most people do not use command-line software.

In order to efficiently use computers, you need to get rid of this mindset.

# Unix Philosophy

Graphical programs do not follow any of these three rules of the Unix philosophy.
The Unix philosophy is important because it outlines the criteria software needs to be considered good.
Command-line programs follow the Unix philosophy most of the time, hence they are good most of the time
Critics of the Unix philosophy argue that “the user interface is horrid” ([Giri, 2021](#ref-windows-kde-plasma)).

## Do one thing and do it well

## Work together

## Handle text streams
