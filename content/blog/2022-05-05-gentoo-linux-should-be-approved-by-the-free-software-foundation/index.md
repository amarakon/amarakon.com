Gentoo Linux is a 100% free operating system.
All of its source code is publicly available on GitHub, meaning that it’s open-source.
It is licensed under a free license: GNU General Public License Version 2.
It does not include any preinstalled proprietary software.
Its package manager, Portage, blocks proprietary software against the user’s will by default.
All of these reasons prove that is a completely free operating system that is against the use of proprietary software, so it should be in the Free Software Foundation’s (FSF) [list of free Linux distributions](https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.en.html).

# Free System Distribution Guidelines ([GNU, 2022](#ref-gnu-fsdg))

The GNU free system distribution guidelines (GNU FSDG) is an article supported by the FSF.
It includes the guidelines that a distribution must follow in order to be endorsed by the FSF.
Gentoo Linux easily follows these guidelines and I will prove it.

## Complete distributions

## License rules

## Non-free firmware

## Non-functional data

## Trademarks

## Documentation

## Patents

## No malware

## Commitment to correct mistakes

## Maintenance

## Name confusion

## Contacting upstream if you are downstream

## Please teach users about free software

## Please avoid repeating propaganda and confusion

# Free Software Foundation’s Justification

The Free Software Foundation justifies not including Gentoo Linux on their list of free Linux distributions with the following short statement: “Gentoo includes installation recipes for a number of nonfree programs in its primary package system.”
This is true, Gentoo does include non-free program packages in its primary package system.
But this should not disqualify Gentoo from being approved by the FSF.
First, the Gentoo wiki does not endorse the installation of these packages.
It has webpages about these packages but they are never unreasonably referenced anywhere, let alone endorsed.
All of the applications and tools recommended and endorsed by Gentoo wiki are free ([Gentoo, 2022a](#ref-gentoo-recommended-applications), [2022b](#ref-gentoo-recommended-tools)).
Even if the Gentoo wiki did endorse proprietary software, that would not matter because then Gentoo wiki is not part of the Gentoo operating system.

The GNU FSDG states “The system should have no repositories for nonfree software and no specific recipes for installation of particular nonfree programs ([GNU, 2022](#ref-gnu-fsdg)).”
Pay attention to the wording.
Gentoo has no repositories **for** non-free software, but it has a repository **with** non-free software.
That is an important distinction.
Like I pointed out earlier, the actual operating system does not contain specific recipes for the installation of particular non-free programs, but the Gentoo wiki reasonably does.
It does not matter whether it is the official Gentoo wiki that includes these recipes or a third-party article.
Neither are included in the operating system.

If Gentoo does not follow the GNU FSDG, then neither do the supposedly free distributions endorsed by the FSF.
It is possible and easy to add proprietary software in these distributions by adding a third-party repository.
The FSF clearly thinks that any distribution which makes it possible to install proprietary software should be disqualified.
I understand this view, but that should make all of the currently approved distributions disqualified as well.
True freedom is giving the user the choice to make responsible and good decisions without any unreasonable authority.
Gentoo Linux is a perfect example of an operating system that gives its users true freedom.
