PDF is rightfully the standard output format for documents.
All word processors can output to PDF, but it is difficult to convert PDF to files word processors can edit.
Most people use "what you see is what you get" word processors like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or LibreOffice Writer.
This type of word processor is convenient but it is also limited and unprofessional.
It is easier to get into, but it is harder to use in the long run.
This is the problem with all "what you see is what you get" programs: they do not follow the "[separation of content and presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_content_and_presentation)" design principle.

Markup word processors are practical and professional alternatives.
However, there are so many of them and all of them are different.
It can be tirelessly difficult to choose the correct one.
It took me a surprisingly long time to choose the correct one for my uses.
And it took me even more time to create [the proper templates](https://github.com/amarakon/amaryaml) for easier use.
Nevertheless, they are still much easier to use in the long run as once you set everything up, the actual usage is simple.
Currently, the best markup word processors are Groff, LaTeX, Markdown, R Markdown, and Quarto.
I will go over the pros and cons of each one so that you can make the best decision.
I do not recommend using any other program than the ones listed in this post because these are the only good ones.

# Groff

Groff (GNU troff) is a document formatting system included with all GNU operating systems.
This makes it very convenient since you do not even have to install it.
Other markup word processors require you to install their packages and these packages can potentially have hundreds of dependencies in total.
Not everyone wants to install them and not everyone has enough storage space to do so.
You can use the `groff_ms` macro package by passing the `-ms` flag to create PDF documents.
It is equally convenient to render the document: running `groff -ms <file>.ms -T pdf > <file>.pdf` will quickly render it.
Other markup word processors take longer to render documents because they are more complex
It is commonly used to create man pages with the `groff_man` macro package.

The main problem with Groff is that it does not have enough features.
Not everything is possible in Groff.
For example: you can create mathematical equations but some of them are not possible.
LaTeX—and all of the other markup languages that use LaTeX to render math (Markdown, R Markdown, Quarto)—can possibly create any mathematical equation.
Groff lacks many other features including templates and geometry margin customization.
All of the documents you create with Groff will look the same, so only consider using it if you like the default appearance.

The syntax for writing Groff documents is also annoying.
All things that must be defined (like section headers and paragraphs) have to be defined using periods and capital letters.
Formatted text (like bold and italics) have to be put on separate lines.
Other than that, the syntax is fine.
But because of Groff's flaws, Groff documents' source code cannot be read easily in plain text.

# LaTeX

LaTeX is the golden standard for making PDF documents, and for good reasons.
It is the very first important markup word processor.
Almost all of the others are based on LaTeX.
And for that, I have to give credit where credit is due.
it does not have any major faults but it is good at pretty much everything.

LaTeX is exceptional at math typesetting.
Most people will always write math on paper.
This has its benefits but it is not impossible to have a nicely formatted and professional document with any math equations.
All of the symbols—including plus and minus signs—are the perfect size as defined by the math font.
Try creating anything like this without using LaTeX:

```{r complex-math-made-by-latex, fig.cap = "Complex math made by LaTeX"}
include_graphics("https://i.stack.imgur.com/vsn9C.png")
```

LaTeX's formatting is exceptional too.
You can easily define everything with just a few commands.
These include page size, text alignment, font size.
It is much easier than having to toggle buttons in a graphical user interface.
Its line and page breaking is the best out of any typesetting program.

```{r latex-line-and-page-breaking, fig.cap = "LaTeX line and page breaking"}
include_graphics("https://i.stack.imgur.com/MgSAz.png")
```

As mentioned before, none of LaTeX's faults are major.
The biggest problem with it is its commands.
All commands use backslashes, which means you have to stretch your pinkie tirelessly often.
Additionally, you have to use some commands just to make a working document.
You cannot compile a document from just simple plain text.
Its syntax is also generally too complicated at times.
A LaTeX document is usually twice the length of an identical Markdown document.
