# Introduction

I am a high school student who happens to be genuinely interested in technology.
Specifically, I am interested in operating systems, programming, and [free software philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement).
I have a good understanding of what makes a good piece of technology and what makes a bad piece of technology.
One of the most important factors in this distinction is the effort it requires to use it.
If a piece of technology is extremely complicated but easy to use (i.e., **dumbed down**), then it is generally bad.
If a piece of technology is minimalist but requires genuine effort to use (e.g., C, LaTeX, flip phones), then it is generally good.

The pandemic gave teachers an excuse to be lazy and government the excuse to be tyrannical.
The government did an uncountable amount of lockdowns and schools went online during them.
Exams were canceled, so it is unsurprising that the majority of students supported the cruel lockdowns as well.
Since we were dependent on technology for school, what I have noticed is that **education wants to dumb down technology**.

# Classroom is Terrible

We used a website developed by Google called [Classroom](https://edu.google.com/workspace-for-education/classroom).
This is the one of the worst websites I have ever had to use in my entire life.
First, it is extremely slow.
Each page takes a couple of seconds to load while most other websites I use load instantly.
The design is also too plain and the website is too bright.
The purpose of these seemingly bad decisions is to dumb it down; to make it accessible to everyone.
This might seem like a good thing to do, but for most people who can actually use computers properly, it slows us down.
If we are dependent on easy-to-use technology, it is inevitable that we become less intelligent.

Another more important reason school boards decided to use Classroom for online education is the fact that Classroom is developed by Google.
Many people think that Classroom is superior because it can easily interact with other Google services such as Meet. 
But this fact does not make Classroom any better, it only makes it worse.
It is designed to create an ecosystem in which everything is more convenient, but everything is also more restrictive.
One of my classes was called ACAM, I forgot what this acronym stands for.
In this class, we used creative technology programs such as Blender, Photoshop, Illustrator.
I thoroughly enjoyed that class, but the main issue that bothered me about it is that we never went in depth.
We were always only at the surface level.

# Wix is a **Scam**

When we were designing our website, we designed them with Wix.
Wix is a website to design websites, and its main attraction is that it is "easy" to use.
Instead of actually writing the code necessary to create a website, **you design a website in the website**.
This is not anywhere near as easy as it sounds.
It took me many hours just to get my blog up and running, and most of the time was not spent actually writing.
This is a classic example of something that is only supposed to appear easy to attract normies into it.
I promise you that not one good, respectable website has ever been designed with Wix or any of those other website-creating websites created **by lazy entrepreneurs for lazy entrepreneurs**.
Likewise, I do not think anyone from my ACAM class will ever grow up to use creative technology in their profession.
They might use it in other school assignments, but probably not in the real world.

**Creative technology education in school is not meant to prepare students for the real world, rather to deter them from it.**
They never taught us actual *HTMl* and *CSS*, or at least any decent package that will convert markup to *HTML* and *CSS*.
Even though those methods require actual effort and perseverance, they are the only way you can make a respectable website.
With Wix, everyone's experience is the basically same.
In my class, the range of marks was not wide; it was surprisingly narrow.
This is not due to lenient marking from my polite teacher—although that could be a factor.
This was mainly due to the fact that **this technology was dumbed down**.
There was no real challenge so there was no real reward either.

## This Website

I created this website with an R package called [*blogdown*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blogdown/index.html), getting it up and running was the terribly hard part.
But after it is up and running, everything else is smooth sailing.
With Wix, getting your website up and running is the easy part—but generally adding things to your website is bound to be difficult.
Moreover, I am in complete control over what my website ends up actually looking like.
Wix cannot possibly give you that control even if it wanted to because you are not working directly with the website.
You are working indirectly with the website and underneath is where Wix itself is handling all the *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript*.
The important "[separation of content and presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_content_and_presentation)" design principle is ignored in favor of the convenient "what you see is what you get" principle.
Most people who use Wix do not even know what those things mean even though they should, as they are not supposed to.

# Computer Science

Since I was only slightly experienced in coding, I joined the computer science club in my school.
I expected to expand my skills to prepare myself for actual coding instead of just writing scripts for my own use.
On my first day in this club, I immediately noticed embarrassing issues.
The teacher was teaching primarily on a white board, making the class seem more like a math class.
Not only that, we were also doing work with a pencil and paper.
In pretty much every other class, teachers have refrained from printing documents and are now creating online assignments on Classroom.
This pathetic downgrade of education has been justified by the irrational excuse of "protecting the environment."
Everyone was used to it after the lockdowns so no one was surprised nor did they care.
I might be completely alone in thinking that all worksheets should be printed for those who do not want to depend on technology.
But I am definitely not alone in thinking that it's ridiculous to be spending most of our time in a computer science class on paper and whiteboards.

The first and only language you learn in computer science club is Python.
There are two problems here: Python is not a good language and schools should teach more than one language.
Python is a mediocre language because even though it has readable syntax, it is extremely slow and inapplicable.
Almquist shells such as DASH and BASH should be taught first due to their ease of use, practicality, and helpfulness.
They are commonly used to automate boring and repetitive tasks.
The vast majority of [my projects](https://github.com/amarakon) on [GitHub](https://github.com) are written in shell; I wrote them for my personal use to automate tasks.
One-letter languages like C and R should be taught afterwards.
They are significantly harder but significantly more powerful as well.
Markup languages, such as LaTeX and Markdown, are also important and are widely used for printing or digital distribution.

# Solution
Like many other problems, this problem has been intentionally created.
It is no accident that schools deter people from being uniquely intelligent.
The education system is designed to sterilize individuality and encourage mob mentality.
The mob mentality thinks "If Wix and Python are the popular choices, they must be good, right?"
The solution to this problem is obvious: The education system should encourage proper and effortful methods as opposed to dumbed down and effortless ones. 
Linux Mint should be the operating system installed on school computers instead of Windows 10.
The *blogdown* package for creating websites should be taught in schools instead of Wix—it is easier, smarter, and better in every way possible.
Shell, C, R, LaTeX, Markdown, HTML, CSS are examples of computer languages that should be taught instead of Python.
