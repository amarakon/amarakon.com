Conservatives and liberals strongly disagree on when killing another human being should be considered acceptable.
They both agree that killing is justified in self-defense, but the agreements end there.
Conservatives usually think that abortion and euthanasia are wrong while capital punishment (the death penalty) is just.
They argue that killing an innocent and defenseless person (abortion and euthanasia) is always wrong while killing soulless criminals (the death penalty) is just.
On the other hand, liberals think that abortion and euthanasia are sometimes justifiable while the death penalty is unjust.
They argue that it is a woman’s right to choose, we should end the suffering of ill people, and that the death penalty is too harsh and cruel.
Both sides cannot seem to understand each other, and they are often heated about these subjects.
The purpose of this post is to present facts and what my opinion on these three subjects are.
I agree with the conservative view that abortion and euthanasia are wrong while capital punishment is just.

# Abortion

Abortion is wrong because it is the killing of an innocent and defenseless child.
This is defined as *infanticide*: the intentional killing of infants or offspring.
Science shows that life undeniably begins at conception ([Miranda & June, 2017](#ref-when-human-life-begins)).
To respond to the argument “A fetus is just a clump of cells,” I can easily say that we are all clumps of cells.
According to the cell theory, all living things are made of cells.
If it is okay to kill clumps of cells, then it is okay to kill anyone.
This argument tries to make the baby seem less important because it is small.
If that is true, killing newborn babies would not be wrong either.
All of the pro-abortion arguments are hypocritical and can be easily refuted by pointing out their hypocrisy.

If you had to choose between a ten-year-old dying and an eighty-year-old dying, which would you pick?
You would probably choose the eighty-year-old.
You do not know if the eighty-year-old is a better person than the ten-year-old.
But most people would choose the eighty-year-old because he already lived most of his life anyways.
We know that it is especially wrong to kill people when they are young because it is robbing them of something valuable that they have not experienced enough yet.
I view abortion in a similar manner: Killing an unborn baby is worse than killing a newborn baby.

## How abortions are performed

If you are pro-abortion, it is important to understand the process of an abortion before you support it.
If you are pro-life, it is not mandatory but recommended to understand the process of an abortion.
Abortion is wrong just from the idea of killing an unborn baby, but it goes further than that.
It is no surprise that most pro-abortion people are unaware of how violent and truly disturbing this procedure is.
If the baby is young enough (less than 13 weeks), the abortionist inserts a vacuum-like tool into the woman’s vagina and since the baby’s bones are not strong enough, all of the baby’s body parts are sucked through the vacuum.
Otherwise, the abortionist has to use a tool to manually break off each of the baby’s body parts and pull them out of the vagina.
You may notice a white fluid flowing out of the cervix, that is the baby’s brain.
In a second-trimester abortion, the “doctor” literally sucks the baby’s brain out.
I was pro-life before researching the process of an abortion, but I considered it a gray area.
There is no changing my mind now, just listening to the procedure described makes me feel sick.

If you still support abortion, search for images of aborted babies.
It is too disturbing for me to show an image here.
If you still support abortion after that, I do not even know what to say to you.

# Capital Punishment

The death penalty should be more controversial than abortion, but it sadly is not.
First, the death penalty is completely constitutional.
It does not violate any human rights and everyone who claims it does speaks broadly.
The constitution of America says that a person may not be “deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.”
This clearly proves that it is okay to deprive someone of life, liberty, and property with due process of law.
If the person killed by the death penalty is truly and rightly convicted, then it is constitutional and just.

Some people might worry that innocent people might be sentenced to death.
Obviously, it is impossible for us to bring a dead innocent person back to life.
But it is surprisingly unlikely for innocent people to be sentenced to death.
There is a long period of time that people sentenced with the death penalty will spend in jail.
The death penalty is not given to people who steal a loaf of bread to their family.
It is not even given to all murderers.
It is given to the most heinous of criminals who deserve no sympathy or mercy.
We should put trust in the criminal justice system and not use errors as an argument.
If it is not trustworthy, it can be improved and we will not have to worry about this.
This is a problem that, if it exists, should be solved directly by improving the justice system and not indirectly by abolishing the death penalty.
We should not worry about this though because all people have the right to due process.

The last and most obvious argument in support of the death penalty is crime control.
Harsher punishments for violent crimes will undoubtedly decrease violent crime rates.
And the only thing harsher than a longer sentence is a sentence to death.
It does not make sense for a person who killed someone to get the same sentence as a serial killer.
The person who killed someone should receive life imprisonment while the the serial killer should receive the death penalty.
After the serial killer dies, they will rightly spend eternity in hell and get just punishment from God after they received just punishment from the justice system.
Because of the death penalty, criminals will think twice before committing heinous crimes.

What I noticed about people who support the death penalty is that they will often feel more sympathy for violent criminals than their victims.
They will claim otherwise but actions speak louder than words.
Kim Kardashian is a perfect example of these types of people.

This is the only tweet I saw her make about the victims of this crime.
She only said it to look fair.
Her heart only breaks for the criminal and not the victim.
Kim Kardashian is a textbook example of a narcissist.

“An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.”

# Euthanasia

Euthanasia (assisted suicide) is a gray area for many people, honestly including myself.
On one hand, it quickly ends the pain and suffering of an ill person.
The word “euthanasia” comes from Greek and it means “good death.”
On the other hand, it is a form of killing an innocent human being.
I lean towards the side of thinking that euthanasia is wrong should be considered murder.

Why do we as a society believe that suicide is wrong?
Because killing innocent people is always wrong, whether it is someone else or yourself.
People who commit suicide irrationally believe that nothing can get better and that everyone will be better off without them.
Everyone else knows this is incorrect, and it causes tremendous pain to everyone who loves that person.
Even if it was somehow correct, that would not justify committing suicide.
Life is precious and it must be preserved as much as possible.
Everyone who commits suicide is mentally ill which causes them to be unable to think clearly.
I view euthanasia in a similar manner as other cases of suicide.
But logically euthanasia is not even suicide; it is assisted suicide.
Assisted suicide is worse than regular suicide because it involves someone who is rational that helps the irrational person do something extremely immoral.
Assisted suicide is homicide, thus euthanasia is homicide.
